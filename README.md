# Deloitte Data Analytics Simulation (Forage)

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**: Analyze machine telemetry data from 4 factories to identify which location and machine types have the most downtime.

ðŸ›  **Tools Used**:
- Tableau
- Calculated Fields
- Interactive Dashboards
- JSON Data Processing

ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**:
Daikibo, a manufacturing client, collected telemetry data across 4 global factories. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard to:
- Calculate total machine downtime using custom logic (`Unhealthy` = 10 mins per bad status)
- Visualize total downtime per factory
- Analyze most failure-prone device types using filters

ðŸ§  **Key Insights**:
- **Berlin factory** had the highest machine downtime in May 2021.
- **CNC Lathe Machines** were the most frequently unhealthy device type.
- Recommended deeper analysis of Berlinâ€™s machine maintenance cycles.


âœ… **Result**:
Created an executive dashboard with filtering capability that helps stakeholders identify weak points in manufacturing systems across factories.
